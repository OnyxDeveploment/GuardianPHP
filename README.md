# GuardianPHP - PHP Security Scanner 🔍🛡️

**GuardianPHP** is an advanced **PHP vulnerability scanner** that helps developers identify security weaknesses in PHP applications. It uses **static analysis** and **regex-based detection** to uncover common vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection, XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and more.**  

---

## ⚡ **Features**
✔ **Static Code Analysis** – Detects security flaws in PHP code by analyzing its structure, variable usage, and function calls.  
✔ **Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection** – Identifies various security risks, including **SQL Injection, XSS, RCE, LFI, OS Command Injection, and more.**  
✔ **Web-Based Interface** – Upload and analyze PHP files through a **user-friendly web UI** at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  
✔ **Detailed Severity Reporting** – Classifies vulnerabilities as **Critical, High, Medium, or Low**, making it easy to prioritize fixes.  
✔ **Real-Time Scanning** – Provides instant results with affected **code snippets and recommended fixes.**  
✔ **Customizable & Extensible** – Developers can extend detection rules to include new security threats.
