# GuardianPHP - PHP Security Scanner üîçüõ°Ô∏è

**GuardianPHP** is an advanced **PHP vulnerability scanner** that helps developers identify security weaknesses in PHP applications. It uses **static analysis** and **regex-based detection** to uncover common vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection, XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and more.**  

---

## ‚ö° **Features**
‚úî **Static Code Analysis** ‚Äì Detects security flaws in PHP code by analyzing its structure, variable usage, and function calls.  
‚úî **Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection** ‚Äì Identifies various security risks, including **SQL Injection, XSS, RCE, LFI, OS Command Injection, and more.**  
‚úî **Web-Based Interface** ‚Äì Upload and analyze PHP files through a **user-friendly web UI** at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  
‚úî **Detailed Severity Reporting** ‚Äì Classifies vulnerabilities as **Critical, High, Medium, or Low**, making it easy to prioritize fixes.  
‚úî **Real-Time Scanning** ‚Äì Provides instant results with affected **code snippets and recommended fixes.**  
‚úî **Customizable & Extensible** ‚Äì Developers can extend detection rules to include new security threats.

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the project directory.
    
2.  Run the vulnerability scanner command, providing the path to the PHP application you want to scan:
    
    
    ```bash
    python GuardianPHP.py
    ```
    

    
3.  Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

4. Upload your PHP file, and the tool will display vulnerabilities along with recommended fixes.

5.  Once the scanning process is complete, the tool will generate a report file containing information about the identified vulnerabilities.
